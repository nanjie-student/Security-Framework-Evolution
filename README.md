The Authentication Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundations
    Level 1: Native Session/Cookie - Mastering state management and JSESSIONID.
Phase 2: Framework Integration (The Jakarta Challenge)

    Level 2: Apache Shiro (Manual Control) - Tackling dependency hell and manual SecurityManager wiring in Spring Boot 3.
    Level 3: Spring Security (DSL) - Leveraging the power of the Spring ecosystem's declarative security.

Phase 3: Modern Architectures (In Progress)
    Level 4: Stateless JWT + Redis - Distributed authentication for decoupled systems.
    Level 5: OAuth2 / OIDC - Understanding third-party identity providers (Google/GitHub).

Phase 4: Advanced Governance
    Level 6: RBAC & ABAC - Fine-grained access control and dynamic database-level permission modeling.



My goal with this repository is to build a comprehensive reference for security architectures.
I'm moving away from just 'using tools' and focusing on the progressive evolution of auth systems. 
By starting with low-level session management and moving up to complex industry standards like OAuth2, 
I'm developing a deep understanding of how security requirements change with system scale.
